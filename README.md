# About
Express-minimalism-blog is my first official fullstack project. It features:
- Node/Express backend
- A protected admin route
- Server side rendering with EJS templates
- SASS
- User verifcation with JSON Web Token

The project is hosted on Glitch (https://concise-spotless-subway.glitch.me). Note: this is a Swedish website.
